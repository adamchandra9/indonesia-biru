                    NTB Just like last year a group of 4 students from the TU Delft traveled to lombok to work on a project on behalf of IBF. Read more about this group and their project. Our team consists of four bachelor students from TU Delft. Steef and Coosje are both fourth year Civil Engineering students, Quirine is a TPM student and I (Imke) am an Architecture student. As you can see we are a quite diverse group which benefits our project work.
